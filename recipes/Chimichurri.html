    <h1>Chimichurri Sauce</h1>

    <p>A Chimichurri sauce is one that invokes a fresh flavor full of herbs and spice, able to be spooned over many different foods. Personally, I enjoy it over a grilled steak. It's combination of red wine vinegar and fresh herbs leaves an extremely enjoyable taste
        and it's something I enjoy very often.

        Hand chopping all the ingredients adds a variety of texture and heterogeneity that is sure to give anyone a dynamic experience, allowing it to stay a sauce rather than become
        a paste.
